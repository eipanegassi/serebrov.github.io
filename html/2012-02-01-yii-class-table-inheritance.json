{"date":"2012-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":"yii","intro":"<h1 id=\"-yii-class-table-inheritance\"> yii - class table inheritance</h1>\n<p>It seems that we have no perfect solution for <a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/classTableInheritance.html\">class table inheritance</a> (or multiple table inheritance) in yii (comparing to the very good one for <a href=\"http://www.yiiframework.com/wiki/198/single-table-inheritance/\">single table inheritance</a>).</p>\n<p>Possible solutions are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add support for class table inheritance to the active record class. There are some implementations of this method (see <a href=\"http://www.yiiframework.com/forum/index.php?/topic/5803-my-multi-table-inheritance-approach/\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.yiiframework.com/forum/index.php?/topic/12978-class-table-inheritance/page__view__findpost__p__64041\">here</a> for examples). But I do not like this approach because it is too complex to implement it properly and to make it work for all possible active record usages.</li>\n<li>Use MySQL VIEWs. MySQL supports a VIEW which can be updated by INSERT and UPDATE statements. So we can hide two tables (for base and child classes) behind the view and use it as a usual single table.</li>\n<li>Use single table inheritance and keep an extended data in separate tables.</li>\n</ol>\n"}
