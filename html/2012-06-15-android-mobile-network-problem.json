I got network indicator (E with two arrows), but can not access network.</p>\n<p>I suspected that this was someting with dns settings, but did not find any solution. I uninstalled busybox, but this didn&#39;t help. I did a factory reset - also didn&#39;t help. Actually I thought factory reset wil return my device to the original state, but then noticed that I still have root and busybox.</p>\n"}
