{"title":"express.js and ejs - reuse template on server and client","date":"2012-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","tags":"ejs,express.js,node.js","intro":"<p><a href=\"https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs\">ejs</a> has a <a href=\"https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs#client-side-support\">client-side support</a> but documentation and examples do not describe how to reuse the same template on the server and on the client side.</p>\n<p>For now I found two ways to do it. First way is to send a request from the client, get a template from a file and render it. And the second - put a template into the page when render it on the server and then just use the template on the client.</p>\n"}
