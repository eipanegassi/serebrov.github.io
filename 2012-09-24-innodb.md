innodb notes
============================================
[innodb docs](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-storage-engine.html)

[isolation levels](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/set-transaction.html)
--------------------------------------------

* REPEATABLE READ (default)
 * in transaction sequential selects will get the same data
* READ COMMITTED
 * in transaction sequential selects can get different (new) data
* READ UNCOMMITTED
 * dirty read, read even not commited data
* SERIALIZABLE
 * SELECTSs are done as SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE
 * so no one can modify data we selected (all selected data becomes read-only)

[lock modes](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-lock-modes.html)
--------------------------------------------

* S (shared)
 * row level, others can get S, IS (select data, but not modify it)
* X (exclusive)
 * row level, others can do nothing
* IS (Intention shared)
 * table-level, others can S, IS, IX (can not modify record, but can do IX)
* IX (Intention exclusive)
 * table-level, others can IS, IX

Note: information about IS/IX locks is (at least for me) a bit confusing, especially this was first very unclear:
"For example, SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE sets an IS lock and SELECT ... FOR UPDATE sets an IX lock."
While in [other chapter](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-locking-reads.html):
"SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE sets a shared mode lock on any rows that are read... (S-lock)" and
"SELECT ... FOR UPDATE locks the rows and any associated index entries, the same as if you issued an UPDATE statement for those rows. ... (X-lock)"

Actually it seems that innodb set both IS and S (or IX and X) where IS is set on the table and S is set on the row:

[SELECT ... FOR UPDATE and SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE Locking Reads - Usage Examples](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-locking-reads.html)
--------------------------------------------
Example 1. Insert a new row into a table child, and make sure that the child row has a parent row in table parent:
* SELECT * FROM parent WHERE NAME = 'Jones' LOCK IN SHARE MODE;
* Now you can safely add the child record to the CHILD table and commit the transaction.
* Any transaction that tries to read or write to the applicable row in the PARENT table waits until you are finished, that is, the data in all tables is in a consistent state.

Example 2. Consider an integer counter field in a table CHILD_CODES, used to assign a unique identifier to each child added to table CHILD:
* SELECT - two users could see the same value for the counter, and a duplicate-key error occurs if two transactions attempt to add rows with the same identifier to the CHILD table.
* SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE - if wo users read the counter at the same time, at least one of them ends up in deadlock when it attempts to update the counter.
* Solution 1:
 * First update the counter by incrementing it by 1, then read it and use the new value in the CHILD table. Any other transaction that tries to read the counter waits until your transaction commits. If another transaction is in the middle of this same sequence, your transaction waits until the other one commits.
  * (update will set X-lock)
* Solution 2:
 * First perform a locking read of the counter using FOR UPDATE, and then increment the counter:
 * SELECT counter_field FROM child_codes FOR UPDATE;
  * (read + set X-lock)
 * UPDATE child_codes SET counter_field = counter_field + 1;
* Both solutions are only examples for SELECT ... FOR UPDATE. In MySQL, the specific task of generating a unique identifier actually can be accomplished using only a single access to the table:
 * UPDATE child_codes SET counter_field = LAST_INSERT_ID(counter_field + 1);
  * here "LAST_INSERT_ID(counter_field + 1)" makes the following "LAST_INSERT_ID()" to return an inserted value (counter_field + 1), so we can know it and use in [other statements](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/information-functions.html#function_last-insert-id)

[Record, Gap, and Next-Key Locks](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-record-level-locks.html)
-------------------------------------------
* Record lock
 * This is a lock on an index record.
 * Record locks always lock index records, even if a table is defined with no indexes. For such cases, InnoDB creates a hidden clustered index and uses this index for record locking. See Section 14.3.11.1, “Clustered and Secondary Indexes”.
* Gap lock
 * This is a lock on a gap between index records, or a lock on the gap before the first or after the last index record.
* [Next-key lock](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-next-key-locking.html)
 * This is a combination of a record lock on the index record and a gap lock on the gap before the index record.
 * By default, InnoDB operates in REPEATABLE READ transaction isolation level and with theinnodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog system variable disabled. In this case, InnoDB uses next-key locks for searches and index scans, which prevents phantom rows (see Section 14.3.9.5, “Avoiding the Phantom Problem Using Next-Key Locking”).
 * If one session has a shared or exclusive lock on record R in an index, another session cannot insert a new index record in the gap immediately before R in the index order.
 * Suppose that an index contains the values 10, 11, 13, and 20. The possible next-key locks for this index cover the following intervals, where ( or ) denote exclusion of the interval endpoint and [ or ] denote inclusion of the endpoint:
  * (negative infinity, 10]
  * (10, 11]
  * (11, 13]
  * (13, 20]
  * (20, positive infinity)
 * For the last interval, the next-key lock locks the gap above the largest value in the index and the “supremum” pseudo-record having a value higher than any value actually in the index. The supremum is not a real index record, so, in effect, this next-key lock locks only the gap following the largest index value.
 * Note: there is no much information about “supremum”, but it seems that it acts as always existing record at the end of the table, so if we do
 * SELECT * FROM child WHERE id > 100 FOR UPDATE; (see example here - http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-next-key-locking.html)
 * then we will block record with id=102, gap before record 102 and also gap before record “supremum”, so it will not be possible to insert something after the 102:
  * create table `child` (`id` int(11) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY(`id`)) ENGINE=InnoDB;
  * insert into child (id) values (90),(102);
   * (1) start transaction;
   * (1) select * from child where id > 100 for update;
   * (2) start transaction;
   * (2) insert into child (id) values (101);
    * wait
 * Gap locking is not needed for statements that lock rows using a unique index to search for a unique row. (This does not include the case that the search condition includes only some columns of a multiple-column unique index; in that case, gap locking does occur.) For example, if the id column has a unique index, the following statement uses only an index-record lock for the row having id value 100 and it does not matter whether other sessions insert rows in the preceding gap:
  * SELECT * FROM child WHERE id = 100;
  * If id is not indexed or has a nonunique index, the statement does lock the preceding gap.
 * A type of gap lock called an insertion intention gap lock is set by INSERT operations prior to row insertion. This lock signals the intent to insert in such a way that multiple transactions inserting into the same index gap need not wait for each other if they are not inserting at the same position within the gap. Suppose that there are index records with values of 4 and 7. Separate transactions that attempt to insert values of 5 and 6 each lock the gap between 4 and 7 with insert intention locks prior to obtaining the exclusive lock on the inserted row, but do not block each other because the rows are nonconflicting.
 * Gap locking can be disabled explicitly. This occurs if you change the transaction isolation level to READ COMMITTED or enable the innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog system variable. Under these circumstances, gap locking is disabled for searches and index scans and is used only for foreign-key constraint checking and duplicate-key checking.

[Locks and statements](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-locks-set.html)
-------------------------------------------
* A locking read (SELECT ... FOR UPDATE and SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE), an UPDATE, or a DELETE
 * next-key locks (index record + gap before, take into account there is "supremum" record)
 * Note: next-key locks are used by default is a default. This can be changed by setting a transaction isolation level or with innodb settings (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-record-level-locks.html)
 * It does not matter whether there are WHERE conditions in the statement that would exclude the row. InnoDB does not remember the exact WHERE condition, but only knows which index ranges were scanned.
 * If a secondary index is used in a search and index record locks to be set are exclusive (X), InnoDB also retrieves the corresponding clustered index records and sets locks on them.
 * If you have no indexes suitable for your statement and MySQL must scan the entire table to process the statement, every row of the table becomes locked, which in turn blocks all inserts by other users to the table. It is important to create good indexes so that your queries do not unnecessarily scan many rows.
  * while here (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-record-level-locks.html): Record locks always lock index records, even if a table is defined with no indexes. For such cases, InnoDB creates a hidden clustered index and uses this index for record locking. See Section 14.3.11.1, “Clustered and Secondary Indexes”.
  * Does it mean that hidden index is used only for record locks, but not in the case of next-key locks?
  * test
   * create table `child` (`id` int(11) NOT NULL) ENGINE=InnoDB;
   * insert into child (id) values (90),(102);
   * (1) start transaction;
   * (1) select * from child where id > 100 for update;
   * (2) start transaction;
   * (2) insert into child (id) values (80);
    * wait
   * so it seems that whole table was locked
* SELECT ... FROM -  consistent read, no locks
* SELECT ... FROM ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE sets shared next-key locks on all index records the search encounters.
* SELECT ... FROM ... FOR UPDATE blocks other sessions from doing SELECT ... FROM ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE or from reading in certain transaction isolation levels. Consistent reads will ignore any locks set on the records that exist in the read view.
 * Note: it blocks everything except plain "SELECT"
* UPDATE ... WHERE ... sets an exclusive next-key lock on every record the search encounters.
* DELETE FROM ... WHERE ... sets an exclusive next-key lock on every record the search encounters.
* INSERT sets an exclusive lock on the inserted row. This lock is an index-record lock, not a next-key lock (that is, there is no gap lock) and does not prevent other sessions from inserting into the gap before the inserted row.
 * Prior to inserting the row, a type of gap lock called an insertion intention gap lock is set. This lock signals the intent to insert in such a way that multiple transactions inserting into the same index gap need not wait for each other if they are not inserting at the same position within the gap.
 * test
  * create table `child` (`id` int(11) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY(`id`)) ENGINE=InnoDB;
  * insert into child (id) values (90),(102);
  * (1) start transaction;
  * (1) insert into child (id) values (93);
  * insert intention lock on gap 90-102
  * X-lock on 93
  * (2) start transaction;
  * (2) insert into child (id) values (97);
  * insert intention lock on gap 90-102
  * X-lock on 97
   * no wait
  * both inserted into the same gap
  * --
  * (1) start transaction;
  * (1) delete from child where id > 100;
  * X lock on gap 90-100 (gap before 100), 100, gap 100-supremum ("supremum" > 100 and fits to condition in 'where')
  * (2) start transaction;
  * (2) insert into child (id) values (105);
  * insert intention on gap 100-supremum;
   * wait
 * (1) insert into child (id) values (107);
  * ok
 * commit;
  * (2) ok
 * If a duplicate-key error occurs, a shared lock on the duplicate index record is set.
  * no error returned now because because other transaction can be rolled back, so it will be no error for current transaction
  * This use of a shared lock can result in deadlock should there be multiple sessions trying to insert the same row if another session already has an exclusive lock.
  * see deadlock example1 and example2
* other statements
 * INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE differs from a simple INSERT in that an exclusive next-key lock rather than a shared lock is placed on the row to be updated when a duplicate-key error occurs.
 * REPLACE is done like an INSERT if there is no collision on a unique key. Otherwise, an exclusive next-key lock is placed on the row to be replaced.
 * INSERT INTO T SELECT ... FROM S WHERE ... sets an exclusive index record without a gap lock on each row inserted into T, sets shared next-key locks on rows from S
 * CREATE TABLE ... SELECT ... performs the SELECT with shared next-key locks or as a consistent read, as for INSERT ... SELECT.
 * When a SELECT is used in the constructs REPLACE INTO t SELECT ... FROM s WHERE ... or UPDATE t ... WHERE col IN (SELECT ... FROM s ...), InnoDB sets shared next-key locks on rows from table s.
* While initializing a previously specified AUTO_INCREMENT column on a table, InnoDB sets an exclusive lock on the end of the index associated with the AUTO_INCREMENT column.
* In accessing the auto-increment counter, InnoDB uses a specific AUTO-INC table lock mode where the lock lasts only to the end of the current SQL statement, not to the end of the entire transaction. Other sessions cannot insert into the table while the AUTO-INC table lock is held;
* If a FOREIGN KEY constraint is defined on a table, any insert, update, or delete that requires the constraint condition to be checked sets shared record-level locks on the records that it looks at to check the constraint. InnoDB also sets these locks in the case where the constraint fails.
* LOCK TABLES sets table locks, but it is the higher MySQL layer above the InnoDB layer that sets these locks.InnoDB is aware of table locks if innodb_table_locks = 1 (the default) and autocommit = 0, and the MySQL layer above InnoDB knows about row-level locks.
 * Otherwise, InnoDB's automatic deadlock detection cannot detect deadlocks where such table locks are involved. Also, because in this case the higher MySQL layer does not know about row-level locks, it is possible to get a table lock on a table where another session currently has row-level locks. However, this does not endanger transaction integrity, as discussed in Section 14.3.9.8, “Deadlock Detection and Rollback”. See alsoSection 14.3.15, “Limits on InnoDB Tables”.

[Deadlock Detection and Rollback](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-deadlock-detection.html)
-------------------------------------------
* InnoDB automatically detects transaction deadlocks and rolls back a transaction or transactions to break the deadlock. InnoDB tries to pick small transactions to roll back, where the size of a transaction is determined by the number of rows inserted, updated, or deleted.
* InnoDB is aware of table locks if innodb_table_locks = 1 (the default) and autocommit = 0, and the MySQL layer above it knows about row-level locks. Otherwise, InnoDB cannot detect deadlocks where a table lock set by a MySQL LOCK TABLES statement or a lock set by a storage engine other than InnoDB is involved. Resolve these situations by setting the value of the innodb_lock_wait_timeout system variable.
* When InnoDB performs a complete rollback of a transaction, all locks set by the transaction are released.
 * However, if just a single SQL statement is rolled back as a result of an error, some of the locks set by the statement may be preserved.
 * This happens because InnoDB stores row locks in a format such that it cannot know afterward which lock was set by which statement.
 * ???
* If a SELECT calls a stored function in a transaction, and a statement within the function fails, that statement rolls back. Furthermore, if ROLLBACK is executed after that, the entire transaction rolls back.

[How to Cope with Deadlocks](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-deadlocks.html)
-------------------------------------------
* InnoDB uses automatic row-level locking. You can get deadlocks even in the case of transactions that just insert or delete a single row. That is because these operations are not really “atomic”; they automatically set locks on the (possibly several) index records of the row inserted or deleted.
* techniques
 * Use SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS to determine the cause of the latest deadlock. That can help you to tune your application to avoid deadlocks.
  * !
 * Always be prepared to re-issue a transaction if it fails due to deadlock. Deadlocks are not dangerous. Just try again.
  * ???
 * Commit your transactions often. Small transactions are less prone to collision.
  * ???
 * If you are using locking reads (SELECT ... FOR UPDATE or SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE), try using a lower isolation level such as READ COMMITTED.
  * ? this can be considered
 * Access your tables and rows in a fixed order. Then transactions form well-defined queues and do not deadlock.
  * ! executing queries which access table in a different order may produce deadlocks
  * see example 3, example 4
 * Add well-chosen indexes to your tables. Then your queries need to scan fewer index records and consequently set fewer locks. Use EXPLAIN SELECT to determine which indexes the MySQL server regards as the most appropriate for your queries.
  * !
 * Use less locking.
  * If you can afford to permit a SELECT to return data from an old snapshot, do not add the clauseFOR UPDATE or LOCK IN SHARE MODE to it. Using the READ COMMITTED isolation level is good here, because each consistent read within the same transaction reads from its own fresh snapshot.
  * ?
 * If nothing else helps, serialize your transactions with table-level locks.
  * The correct way to use LOCK TABLES with transactional tables, such as InnoDB tables, is to begin a transaction with SET autocommit = 0 (not START TRANSACTION) followed by LOCK TABLES, and to not call UNLOCK TABLES until you commit the transaction explicitly. For example, if you need to write to table t1 and read from table t2, you can do this:
  * SET autocommit=0;
  * LOCK TABLES t1 WRITE, t2 READ, ...;... do something with tables t1 and t2 here ...
  * COMMIT;
  * UNLOCK TABLES;
  * Table-level locks make your transactions queue nicely and avoid deadlocks.
 * create an auxiliary “semaphore” table that contains just a single row. Have each transaction update that row before accessing other tables. In that way, all transactions happen in a serial fashion.

Deadlock examples
-------------------------------------------
Example 1 (deadlock on insert):
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-locks-set.html
CREATE TABLE t1 (i INT, PRIMARY KEY (i)) ENGINE = InnoDB;
(1) START TRANSACTION;
(1) INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1);
X lock
(2) START TRANSACTION;
(2) INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1);
duplicate-key error -> S lock
(3) START TRANSACTION;
(3) INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1);
duplicate-key error -> S lock
(1) ROLLBACK;
(2) & (3) - deadlock - both hold S-lock and can not get X-lock
Example 2 (deadlock on delete / insert):
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-locks-set.html
CREATE TABLE t1 (i INT, PRIMARY KEY (i)) ENGINE = InnoDB;
(1) START TRANSACTION;
(1) DELETE FROM t1 WHERE i = 1;
X lock
(2) START TRANSACTION;
(2) INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1);
duplicate-key error -> S lock
(3) START TRANSACTION;
(3) INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1);
duplicate-key error -> S lock
(1) ROLLBACK;
(2)-(3) - deadlock - both hold S-lock and can not get X-lock
Example 3 (deadlock on access in different order):
http://thushw.blogspot.com/2010/11/mysql-deadlocks-with-concurrent-inserts.html
I was unable to reproduce a deadlock with example from the post (maybe mysql improved since then with insert intention locks)
create table vegetable (id bigint(10) NOT NULL auto_increment, name varchar(255) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (id), UNIQUE KEY uk_name (name)) ENGINE=InnoDB;
insert into vegetable (id, name) values (10, "ggg"), (5, "jjj");
(1) start transaction;
(1) insert into vegetable values(null, "ppp");
lock the gap between "jjj" and "ppp"
actually: insert intention lock / X-row lock
(2) start transaction;
(2) insert into vegetable values(null, "iii");
locking the gap after "ggg", upto "iii"
actually: insert intention lock / X-row lock
(2) insert into vegetable values (null, "mmm");
lock the gap after "jjj" upto "mmm". Since connection 1 has a lock between "jjj" and "ppp", effectively spanning the lock connection 2 is attempting to take, this will block
actually: no block, OK
(1) insert into vegetable values (null, "hhh");
This requires the gap lock between "ggg" and "hhh". This will block as it spans the the lock ["ggg" to "iii"] held by connection 2.
actually: OK
OK because insert do not do next-key blocking, but sets insert intention lock, so such inserts work ok.
Modified example with updates:
Example with deadlock - inserts are combined with updates which actually do next-key locking
create table vegetable (id bigint(10) NOT NULL auto_increment, name varchar(255) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (id), UNIQUE KEY uk_name (name)) ENGINE=InnoDB;
insert into vegetable (id, name) values (10, "ggg"), (5, "jjj");
(1) start transaction;
(1) update vegetable set name="jjj1" where name > 'jjj';
lock the gap between "jjj" and "supremum" (pseudo record beyond the table end)
(2) start transaction;
(2) update vegetable set name="ggg1" where name < 'jjj';
locking the gap after "ggg", upto "jjj"
(2) insert into vegetable values (null, "mmm");
insert intention lock - gap after "jjj", wait for lock set by (1)
wait
(1) insert into vegetable values (null, "hhh");
insert intention lock - gap after "ggg", wait for lock set by (2)

(2) start transaction;

why it does not wait? It seems that it gets a lock for the same gap.
(1) insert into T set C = 42;
insert intention
wait for gap lock (2)
(2) insert into T set C = 42;
insert intention
wait for gap lock (1)

oAuth 1.0 flow
-----------------

A good explanation image from [oauth.net](http://oauth.net/core/1.0/):

![oAuth flow](2012-03-15-oauth-1-0-diagram.png)

Flow description:

* Consumer has Consumer Key and Consumer Secret (shared secret)
* A) Consumer requests Request Token
  * call `get_request_token` from Service Provider, send
    * `oauth_consumer_key`
    * `oauth_signature_method`
    * `oauth_signature`
    * ...
    * here `oauth_signature` - is signature of the request created using Consumer Secret, simplified example:
    * `$signature = md5($request_text . $consumer_secret)`
    * both sides (Consumer and Service Provider) knows consumer_secret and able to perform this operation, so Service Provider can check whether signature is valid
* B) Service provider returns Request Token
  * `oauth_token`
  * `oauth_token_secret`
* C) Consumer redirects User to Service Provider
  * `oauth_token` (request token from B)
* D) User confirms access and Service Provider redirects User to Consumer
  * `oauth_token` (request token from B)
  * `oauth_verifier` (request token verifier)
* E) Consumer requests Access Token
  * call `get_access_token`, send
    * `oauth_consumer_key`
    * `oauth_token` (request token from B)
    * `oauth_signature_method`
    * `oauth_signature`
    * ...
    * `oauth_verifier`
  * here `oauth_signature` - is signature of the request created using request token secret from B
  * note, that on step A Consumer uses his Consumer Secret to sign the request and here he use request token secret
* F) Service provider grants Access Token
  * `oauth_token`
  * `oauth_token_secret`
* G) Consumer Accesses Protected Resources
  * request includes
    * `oauth_consumer_key`
    * `oauth_token` (request token from F)
    * `oauth_signature_method`
    * `oauth_signature`
    * ...
    * here `oauth_signature` created using Access Token secret
